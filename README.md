## Network Topology
Network topologic structure is a diagram that consists of network node equipment and communication medium(from Baidu baike).

## About Project

This solution is a complex html5 graphical system, be used to telecom/enterprise user. Graphical based on SVG, and equips with a series of UI kits, then you can be more intuitive to understand how the project works.  

Topology was developed in 2013, to be clear, the Topology in GitHub is just a **simple example**, or a thin version. The reason: Firstly, I retain the part of rich client only(the Server is secondary); Secondly, the integrated Topology include a lots of graphics solutions(such as BI diagram, virtual private networks, virtualized resources networks in cloud computing, etc.), let's simplify it, and take the focus on the technology.
